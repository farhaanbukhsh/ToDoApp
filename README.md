# ToDo App

This app is an attempt to learn react-native. The basic CRUD app is there and it works. There has to be improvements no doubt.

# Improvements

Database layer is not at all touched, this can be a nice addition to the project, since the data now is `static`.

## Steps to run the app

Note: This app is assuming that you have gone through initial react-native documentation and configured your emulator and devices.

* Clone the repository
* cd  TodoApp
* Connect your device or emulator
* Run command  `react-native run-android`
* If everything done right you should see the app boot up
